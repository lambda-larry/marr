# Ansible ripoff ripoff

A ripoff of a software that tries to ripoff Ansible...

DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION!

## Purpose and motivation of this software

To automate setup and mangagement of Linux servers.

The software we are ripping off (`X`) is built on top of a build system `Y`
(like Rake or CMake) with an embedded DSL which is also turing complete.
Therefore we will be using GNU make to ilustrate the absurdity `X`.

The build system `Y` in software `X` belongs to the Java ecosystem.
